/**
 * This is a small, not-overly-simple demo that presents some important features of SquidLib and shows a faster,
 * cleaner, and more recently-introduced way of displaying the map and other text. Features include dungeon map
 * generation, field of view, pathfinding (to the mouse position), simplex noise (used for a flickering torch effect),
 * language generation/ciphering, color manipulation, and ever-present random number generation (with a seed).
 * You can increase the size of the map on most target platforms (but GWT struggles with large... anything) by
 * changing gridHeight and gridWidth to affect the visible area or bigWidth and bigHeight to adjust the size of the
 * dungeon you can move through, with the camera following your '@' symbol.

    //Here, gridHeight refers to the total number of rows to be displayed on the screen.
    //We're displaying 25 rows of dungeon, then 7 more rows of text generation to show some tricks with language.
    //gridHeight is 25 because that variable will be used for generating the dungeon (the actual size of the dungeon
    //will be triple gridWidth and triple gridHeight), and determines how much off the dungeon is visible at any time.
    //The bonusHeight is the number of additional rows that aren't handled like the dungeon rows and are shown in a
    //separate area; here we use them for translations. The gridWidth is 90, which means we show 90 grid spaces
    //across the whole screen, but the actual dungeon is larger. The cellWidth and cellHeight are 10 and 20, which will
    //match the starting dimensions of a cell in pixels, but won't be stuck at that value because we use a "Stretchable"
    //font, and so the cells can change size (they don't need to be scaled by equal amounts, either). While gridWidth
    //and gridHeight are measured in spaces on the grid, cellWidth and cellHeight are the initial pixel dimensions of
    //one cell; resizing the window can make the units cellWidth and cellHeight use smaller or larger than a pixel.
